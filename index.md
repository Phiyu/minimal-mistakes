## 👋 Hi, welcome to my homepage~

I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Astronomy at the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) (USTC, Class of 2023),  and a member of the Wang Shouguan Astronomy Talent Program.

I am broadly interested in **cosmology**, **gravitation**, and **theoretical astrophysics**, with a long-term goal of pursuing a PhD in physics or astronomy.

<!-- I have participated in the [Undergraduate Research Program (URP)](https://www.nao.cas.cn/yjsjy/bsrc/urp/) at the National Astronomical Observatories of China (NAOC), where I studied fundamental cosmology, linear perturbation theory, and large-scale simulations. This research produced a detailed report and a simple Python package for visualization and analysis. -->

## 🧠 Research Strengths & Skills

As my advisor once told me: *"A good cosmologist should have a solid theoretical foundation, strong coding skills, and a good understanding of astronomical observations."*  
I have been striving to grow in all three areas throughout my undergraduate research journey.

### 📘 Theoretical Foundations

- Solid background in classical and modern physics, including general relativity and cosmology
- Strong self-learning ability and curiosity about modern theoretical developments

### 💻 Coding & Computational Skills

- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
- LaTeX (scientific writing, equations, CV formatting)
- Developed a small research package during URP at NAOC

### 🔭 Observational & Survey Literacy

- Currently studying Galaxy Astronomy and Physical Cosmology
- Familiar with the concept of wide-angle effects in redshift-space distortions (RSD)
- Interested in connecting simulations with real survey strategies

## 🎯 Future Goals

I am preparing for graduate study and actively developing my research abilities in both theory and computation. I enjoy challenges, adapt quickly to new topics, and communicate clearly in both written and spoken settings.
