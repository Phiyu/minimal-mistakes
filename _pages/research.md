Galaxy redshift surveys provide crucial observational data for studying the large-scale structure of the universe and testing cosmological models. When the field of view is narrow, it is common to adopt the plane-parallel approximation, assuming that lines of sight to different galaxies are nearly parallel. However, as the angular extent of the survey increases, the actual line-of-sight directions vary significantly, leading to what is known as wide-angle effects.

Investigating wide-angle effects in large galaxy surveys helps improve the accuracy of power spectrum and correlation function calculations by reducing systematic errors. This, in turn, contributes to more reliable data analysis tools for probing the large-scale structure of the universe.
